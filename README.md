# Image-Recognition-Deep-Learning
 A deep learning-based project for recognizing and classifying images using CNN.

 🧠 Image Recognition & Classification using Deep Learning

Welcome to the Image Recognition & Classification project! This deep learning-powered system is designed to identify and categorize images using advanced neural network architectures — primarily Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

“A picture is worth a thousand words. With deep learning, it can now tell them.”

How It Works

1. Data Collection – Collect and organize images into labeled folders  
2. Preprocessing – Resize, normalize, and augment images  
3. Model Building – Design a CNN architecture using Keras  
4. Training – Train the model on labeled data  
5. Evaluation – Test accuracy using validation/test sets  
6. Prediction – Classify new, unseen images

Installation & Run

Clone the repository and install required packages:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/Image-Recognition-Deep-Learning.git  
cd Image-Recognition-Deep-Learning  
pip install -r requirements.txt  
jupyter notebook

Open the file image_classifier.ipynb to get started.

Results

- Achieved approximately XX% accuracy on test data  
- Visualized loss/accuracy graphs  
- Confusion matrix for class-wise performance  
(Note: Update after training your model)
